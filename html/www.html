            <h2>GRACE (Giving Relief and Care Everywhere)</h2>
            <p>The online system for charity management that this project will design allows for ease of contribution by donors, increases the participation of local businesses in charitable activities, and ensures that disabled individuals receive the help they deserve.
                Building up a relationship with local businesses, like hotels and service providers that will be involved in order fulfillment and distribution to people in need.Helping others brings immense benefits, not just to those who receive assistance, but also to the ones offering their help. When we extend a hand to someone in need, we create a ripple effect of kindness and compassion that strengthens communities and fosters a sense of unity. It can improve emotional well-being, providing a sense of purpose and fulfillment.
